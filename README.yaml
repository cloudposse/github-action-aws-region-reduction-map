# Short description of this project
description: Converts AWS region names from full names to abbreviations

introduction: |-
  Converts AWS region names from full names to either
  "fixed" (always 3 characters) or "short" (usually 4 or 5 characters)
  abbreviations, following the same map as
  https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-utils
  
  Short abbreviations are generally the same as official AWS 
  availability zone IDs.
  
  Generally, AWS region names have 3 parts and the "fixed" abbreviation
  is the first character of each part. Exceptions (due to collisions):
  - Africa and China use second letter of first part.
  - ap-south-1 is shortened to as0 to avoid conflict with ap-southeast-1
  - cn-north-1 is shortened to nn0 to avoid conflict with cn-northwest-1
  
  You should be able to list all regions with this command:
  aws ec2 describe-regions --all-regions --query "Regions[].{Name:RegionName}" --output text
  but actually it leaves out GovCloud and China
  See https://github.com/jsonmaur/aws-regions for more complete list

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  ### Convert AWS region (ex.: `us-west-2`) to fixed abbreviation - will be `uw2`.
  ```yaml
    name: Pull Request
    on:
      pull_request:
        branches: [ 'main' ]
        types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed, labeled, unlabeled]

    jobs:
      context:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: cloudposse/github-action-aws-region-reduction-map@main
            id: aws_map
            with:
              region: 'us-west-2'
              ## Format can be skipped - default format would be `fixed` if region is long 
              format: 'fixed'
  
        outputs:
          result: ${{ steps.aws_map.outputs.result }}
  ```

  ### Convert AWS region (ex.: `us-west-2`) to short abbreviation - will be `usw2`.
  ```yaml
    name: Pull Request
    on:
      pull_request:
        branches: [ 'main' ]
        types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed, labeled, unlabeled]

              format: 'short'
  
        outputs:

        outputs:
          result: ${{ steps.aws_map.outputs.result }}
  ```

  ### Convert fixed AWS region (ex.: `uw2`) to long abbreviation - will be `us-west-2`.
